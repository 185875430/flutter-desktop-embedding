# Testbed Application

This application is intended as a useful tool for developing and testing
the [desktop
libraries](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Desktop-shells), as well
as the plugins that are part of this repository.

If you aren't working on the libraries themselves, this application is
unlikely to be useful to you; see the [example](../example/) instead.

Since it serves as simple test environment for the plugins that are part of
this project, and some desktop-specific Flutter functionality, it is a
collection of unrelated functionality rather than a usable application.

## Building and Running

The examples build the plugins from source, so you will need to ensure you
have all the dependencies for
[building the plugins on your platform](../plugins/README.md).

Otherwise, other than the exact paths and project names, the instructions
are the same as for the [example application](../example/README.md).
